        <p>You know the drill. Let's just get started!</p>
        <h3>Otter.ai</h3>

It can help you write notes and summarize meetings 30x faster. You can collaborate with teammates in the live transcript by adding comments, highlighting key points, and assigning action items. Otter can be connected to your Google or Microsoft calendar and it can automatically join and record your meetings on Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet. You can follow along live on the web or in the iOS or Android app. After the meeting, Otter generates and emails a summary that allows you to easily recall and share key information, saving you time from having to revisit the entire transcript.</p>
        <h3>Brain.fm</h3>
        <p>Brain.fm is music designed for the brain (generated by an AI) to improve focus, productivity, flow, studying, momentum, concentration, and to support with ADHD. Brain.fm’s focus music is made to help you work better by blending into the background so you can focus distraction-free… all while stimulating the brain with gentle rhythmic pulses in the music that support sustained attention. Other music is made to grab your attention, making it hard to think and work, even if you don’t realize it. Brain.fm can be used on Google Play or on their website.</p>

        <h1>How to Build a Sellable Side-Project in 5 Months: From Idea to Acquisition</h1>
        <p>Jake Prins</p>
        <p>In just five short months, my idea went from concept to acquisition. This is my second acquisition this year, and I’ll share how I did it in this post.</p>
        <h3>The beginning of the story</h3>
        <p>It all started when the ChaptGPT/AI hype dominating Twitter got the best of me, and I wanted to experiment with whatever all the buzz was about. I decided to build a small project using The OpenAI API to learn more. I was careful to keep it small and manageable because I already work for Apideck, have two young children, and spend most of my free time working on universal.page. So basically, I didn’t have the time for this.</p>
        <p>For a short period, I was blocked from progressing on universal.page due to some LUKSO contract updates, so this gave me a little window of time to experiment with AI stuff. That’s when I created TeamSmart AI, a browser extension allowing you to add different AI characters to your team and have them as sidekicks wherever you go. Within just one month, I made my first sale!</p>
        <p>These are the steps I took I believe to have contributed most to the success of this side project.</p>

        <h1>You Need to Know These Metrics as a Product Manager</h1>
        <pw>Jayendra More</p>
        <p>The life of a Product Manager is not easy, you are always tasked with keeping your users happy, stakeholders happy, management team happy, marketing and tech team happy, and CSE team happy and even after this if you have any life left you need to keep your family happy. To keep all those folks happy you always need to monitor some things from your product so you know that your product is on the right track and everything is in check.</p>
        <p>As a Product Manager (PM), being aware of the right metrics is important for effectively measuring and tracking the progress of your product. Following are some of the metrics that a Product Manager should be aware of:</p>
        <h3>1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h3>
        <p>KPIs are high-level metrics and your product's overall goals are tied up to them. Every product/company has their own set of KPIs which varies based on the nature of the product. Some examples of the metrics are Revenue, Customer Acquisition, Conversion Rate, Retention Rate, etc. which will be covered later in the blog.</p>
        <h3>2. Engagement Metrics</h3>
        <p>These metrics help you to understand how actively your users are interacting with your product. Some examples of these Metrics are Daily Active Users(DAU), Weekly Active Users(WAU), Monthly Active Users(MAU), time spent by the user on the app, userâ€™s session length, etc.</p>
        <p>I've tried to cover as many metrics as possible for Product Managers in the blog. This blog aims to help you understand basic metrics that a PM should know about. This blog is not only meant for PMs but also for others can get enlightened on the topic as knowledge never hurts. I would love to hear your thoughts on the topic in the comments.

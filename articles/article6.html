        <h1>How To Make Millions With AI</h1>
        <p>Godfrey The Great</p>
        <p>I love AI. Ever since I began using Chat GPT, I pretty much use it everyday. It’s like my personal assistant that never talks back or refuses to co-operate (unless I’m being cheeky of course). When I first started using it, loads of ideas started flooding into my mind.</p>
        <p>Now don't get me wrong, there are definitely ventures worth pursuing here. You could set up a website with billions of blog posts all covering one niche. Those blog posts could help you rank high on Google. You could set up social media pages to repurpose your blog content and build an audience. From there you can drive people to your site and either offer your own products/services or other people’s. This could work. But it’s hardly passive. Have you ever tried setting up your own website? It’s not that easy, especially for technological troglodytes like me. You could also use image generation tools like Midjourney to create print on demand designs instantly. From there, you can upload those designs onto all of the different free marktetplaces like Teespring, Teepublic and Zazzle. If you keep doing this and your designs are optimised, you could make plenty of passive cash without having to lift a finger. That sounds too good to be true doesn’t it? Well, it is. I tried this business idea for a month and got bored so quickly. This fast cash mindset is stupid and I was the prime subject. I have made some sales from this idea, but my margins were hopeless. I think I got $3 for every sale. Therefore, to make a million dollars, I’d need to sell a lot more than what I did. Could this definitely work? Yes. I just didn’t enjoy it.</p>
